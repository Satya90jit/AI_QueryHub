# üìÑ Document Management & NLP Querying System

A secure, scalable full-stack application for document management and contextual querying powered by advanced RAG (Retrieve and Generate) agents. Users can upload and interact with various document types using intelligent NLP-driven query responses.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-Format Document Upload**: Effortlessly upload and manage PDF, PPT, CSV, and more.
- **NLP Querying with RAG Agents**: Get accurate, contextually relevant answers to questions based on document content.
- **Advanced Document Parsing**: Extract text and metadata for efficient querying and categorization.
- **Secure Authentication**: Session-based authentication with OAuth2.0 or JWT options.
- **Scalable and Reliable**: Built for high performance, security, and scalability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **NLP Processing**: LangChain / LLamaIndex
- **RAG Agents**: Autogen / Crewai (or equivalent)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Redis
- **File Storage**: AWS S3
- **Search Engine**: Elasticsearch
- **Document Parsing**: unstructured.io for advanced document content extraction
- **Authentication**: Session-based, with OAuth2.0 or JWT support

## üìê Architecture & Design

### Low-Level Design (LLD)

The application follows a modular architecture, prioritizing maintainability and scalability.

- **Database Schema**: Optimized tables with normalization, foreign keys, and indexes for efficient querying.
- **Classes & Relationships**: Clear class definitions and dependencies, adhering to SOLID principles.
- **Extensibility**: Open-close relationships ensure new features can be added without altering existing code.

### Key Modules

1. **Document Upload & Management**

   - Secure storage on AWS S3, integrated with unstructured.io for parsing.
   - Real-time extraction and storage of metadata for document categorization.

2. **NLP & RAG Querying**
   - Uses LangChain / LLamaIndex for document indexing.
   - RAG Agents (Autogen/Crewai or equivalent) for generating contextually relevant responses.
